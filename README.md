## 🧪 Lab Tasks & Code Highlights

### ✅ 1. NumPy

* Create and manipulate arrays
* Perform addition, dot product, transpose

```python
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = np.ones((2, 2))
sum_ab = a + b
product = np.dot(a, b)
```

---

### ✅ 2. Pandas

* Create DataFrame
* Add computed column (`Passed`)
* Calculate mean score

```python
df['Passed'] = df['Score'] > 90
mean_score = df['Score'].mean()
```

---

### ✅ 3. SciPy

* T-test between groups
* Calculate area under a curve

```python
t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(group1, group2)
area = integrate.quad(lambda x: x**2, 0, 3)[0]
```

---

### ✅ 4. Scikit-learn

* Load Iris dataset
* Train/test split
* Build Random Forest model
* Evaluate with accuracy

```python
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
```

---

### ✅ 5. Matplotlib

* Plotting y = x² with labels and grid

```python
plt.plot(x, y, label='y = x^2', marker='o')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

| Dataset                     | ML Task Type                        | Source     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Loan Amount Prediction      | Regression / Classification         | Kaggle     |
| Handwritten Character Recog | Multi-class Classification          | UCI/Kaggle |
| Email Spam / MNIST          | Binary / Multi-class Classification | UCI/Kaggle |
| Predicting Diabetes         | Binary Classification               | UCI (Pima) |
| Iris Dataset                | Multi-class Classification          | UCI        |

## 🔄 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Load Data** – using `pandas`, `NumPy`
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** – `describe()`, `info()`, plots
3. **Preprocessing** – handle missing values, encoding, normalization
4. **Feature Selection** – `SelectKBest`, Chi-square, ANOVA
5. **Splitting Data** – `train_test_split()`
6. **Model Building** – training using classifiers/regressors
7. **Evaluation** – accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, silhouette score

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

* Mastered the use of essential Python libraries for ML
* Practiced real-world ML workflows (EDA → preprocessing → model)
* Identified correct algorithms for datasets (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes)
* Visualized data and model results using plots
* Gained hands-on experience with datasets like Iris, MNIST, Diabetes, etc.
